.SH NAME
Ucrypt \-  Data Encryption Software

.SH SYNOPSIS
ucrypt [-a -e -d -s -ef -df -g -h -k -dk -p -P -x -t -v -pub -pvt -in -out]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ucrypt is a versatile encryption tool, written in Python and designed to meet the demands of the most security-conscious software users.
.SH OPTIONS
Usage: ucrypt [[OPTION [ARG]]...]
.SH
.SH AES Encryption:
 -a  --auth                  Create or reset a password to generate key derivative from it
 -d  --decrypt       [FILE]  Decrypt a file using a key, works with -k, otherwise default key will be used
 -e  --encrypt       [FILE]  Encrypt a file using a key, works with -k, otherwise default key will be used
 -s  --save-as       [FILE]  Filename to save the encrypted or decrypted data
 -ef --enable-factor         Enable second factor to encrypt and decrypt data with auth password
 -df --disable-factor        Disable second factor to encrypt and decrypt data with auth password
 -g  --generate-key  [FILE]  Path with filename to generate and store a new key
                             if no path, default key path stored in config file will be used
 -h  --help                  List of options and information about Ucrypt
 -k  --key           [FILE]  Specify a key to be used to encrypt or decrypt
 -dk --default-key   [FILE]  Set a key as default key
 -p  --password              Use with -g to generate a derivative key from password
 -P                  [TEXT]  Password to protect the key as argument on command line
 -x  --no-pass               Don't use password even if second factor is enabled
 -t  --status                Display Ucrypt configuration status
 -v  --version               Show Ucrypt version


.SH Hybrid encryption with RSA:

 -pub --encrypt-with [FILE]  Your openssl public key, needs to use with -in and -out options
 -pvt --decrypt-with [FILE]  Your openssl private key, needs to use with -in and -out options
 -in                 [DATA]  Your data to be encrypted or decrypted. Can be a file or a directory
 -out                [FILE]  Filename or directory name to store the encrypted or decrypted data
                             When encrypted result will always be a single file, when decrypted
                             it will depend on the encrypted input, if was a directory or a file


 Config file location:       /etc/ucrypt/ucrypt.conf
